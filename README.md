# QOSF2022Cohort6Task1
This is my code for the QOSF 2022 Mentorship program, specifically for Task 1 (Multiplyer) for Cohort 6.
The code was made exclusively on a notebook via IBM's quantum development platform, with all the code being imported here as a completed notebook.
The quantum-related aspect of this code is seen in a quantum-addition function, where I had to learn which types of gates are needed for a quantum full-adder.
Finally, the multiplier function is made with a simple for loop and classical python code.
