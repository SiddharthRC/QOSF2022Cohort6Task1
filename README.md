# QOSF2022Cohort6Task1
This is my code for the QOSF 2022 Mentorship program, specifically for Task 1 (Multiplyer) for Cohort 6.
The code was made exclusively on a notebook via IBM's quantum development platform, with all the code being imported here as a completed notebook.
The quantum-related aspect of this code is seen in a quantum-addition function, where I had to learn which types of gates are needed for a quantum full-adder.
Finally, the multiplier function is made with a simple for loop and classical python code. 
Note that the output is a float, to allow for multiplications with numbers that do not have an integer product.
Finally, all quantum-related code is run on the statevector-simulator and there is not condition in program checking for the length of the inputs, so make sure not to use numbers too large for the statevector-simulator to handle.
Thank you for looking at my code.
